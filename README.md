# Susy Snippets

This is a collection of Sublime Text snippets for [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) 2. These will work on files with the `.sass` and `.scss` extension for now.

## Installation

To install these snippets, navigate to your Sublime Text User directoy in Terminal. This is nested fairly deep, so it might be easiest while in Sublime Text to go: Sublime Text > Preferences > Browse Packages... and then drag your User directory onto your terminal (after typing in the `cd` command, of course). Once in the directory, you can clone the repo and Sublime Text should be all set to use these snippets.
